# _Bootstrap Methods: Another look at the Jackknife_
### B. Efron

---

## Introduction 
The format of this blog post will be as follows. In [Section I](#sec1) we begin with a summary and clear description of the main topics discussed in Efron's paper. In [Section II](#sec2), we will include the proofs of major theorems and remarks made. Lastly, in [Section III](#sec3), we will include illustrative examples and simulations that help the reader understand the impact and importance of Bootstrap.

### Bootstrap Methods
The ultimate goal of the methods outlined in bootstrap are to take observations, $\bb{X}$, from an unknown distribution, $F$, and understanding the sampling distribution of a chosen random quantity, $R(\bb{X}, F)$, of interest using only the observed data you have available. In the context of this paper, there existed a method called "Jackknife" which mainly worked for two forms of the $R(\bb{X}, F)$ that is
\begin{align*}
R(\bb{X}, F) &= t(\bb{X}) - \theta(F)\\
R(\bb{X}, F) &= \frac{t(\bb{X}) - \widehat{Bias}(t) - \theta(F)}{\sqrt{\widehat{Var}(t)}}
\end{align*}
where $t(\bb{X})$ estimates $\theta(F)$. What is worth noting is that jackknife approximates the distribution of $R$ by sampling $n-1$ times \textbf{with} replacement. Bootstrap is then introduced and follows the general framwork below

\begin{itemize}
  \item Given the existing data $\bb{X} = (x_1,...,x_n)$, assign each data point probability $1/n$ such that selecting an observation from the sample has equal probability. 
  \item Sample from $\bb{X}$ \textbf{with} replacement to get $\bb{X}^*$  which has data points ${x_1^*, ..., x_n^*} \subseteq \bb{X}$. Do this multiple times since each $\bb{X_i^*}$ will be from the sampling distribution $\hat{F}$.
  \item Now we get the \textit{bootstrap distribution} which is the "empirical distribution" for $R(\bb{X},F)$, namely $R^* = R(\bb{X^*}, \hat F)$.
\end{itemize}
